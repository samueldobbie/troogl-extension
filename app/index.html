                <div style="margin-bottom: 2.5%;">
                    <p>
                        Thank you for being one of the first people to try Troogl!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Troogl is a browser extension that aims to improve the experience of reading news articles by providing
                        you with interesting, real-time insights into articles as you read them. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h1 class="header">1. How do I use it?</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        To get started:
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>Add the extension to your browser, <a class="link" href="" onclick="alert('Will be added soon!');">here</a> (only on Chrome at the moment).</li>
                            <li>Visit any news article.</li>
                            <li>Click the Troogl plugin icon <img style="width: 20px;" src="images/icon32.png"> in the top right corner of your browser window.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Troogl will analyse the article and display the results directly within the page, as shown below. This typically takes less than 10 seconds, but lengthy articles can take longer.

                </div>

                <h1 class="header" style="margin-top: 2.5%;">2. What can I do with Troogl?</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Right now, Troogl primarily provides insights into the sentiment of articles (e.g. how positive, neutral or negative sentences are).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The current features of Troogl include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Color-coded sentences based on the sentiment (green = positive, grey = neutral, red = negative).</li>
                            <li>A line graph that highlights the changing sentence sentiments over the course of the article.</li>
                            <li>Easy navigation of sentences by hovering over different points within the line graph.</li>
                            <li>A dropdown to switch between perspectives, enabling you to view the sentiment of sentences from the perspective of people and organizations mentioned in the article.</li>
                            <li>A piechart breakdown of sentence sentiments based on the counts of each sentiment type.</li>
                            <li>A more extensive dashboard that gives a summary of the article, the read time, the readability, the objectivity, and an overview of the people and organizations that are mentioned positively and negatively.</li>
                            <li>...many other features in the works!.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h1 class="header" style="margin-top: 2.5%;">3. Things to keep in mind</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Please keep in mind that Troogl is very early in its development, so there will inevitably be a bunch of issues that have yet to be discovered (to go along with the bunch that already have been!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the main areas that need to be improved is the accuracy of sentiment, particularly from the default <i>Everyday News Reader</i> perspective. To address this, work is being done to incorporate a voting mechanism that will enable users to contribute their own opinion as to the correct sentiment classifications. This will help to improve accuracy over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Troogl doesn't store any data at all, and will only operate on the tab you're currently viewing <b>after</b> you click the plugin icon.
                    </p>
