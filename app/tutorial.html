                    <p>
                        Thank you for being one of the first people to try Troogl!

                        Troogl is a browser extension that aims to improve the experience of reading news articles by providing
                        you with interesting, real-time insights into news articles, as you read them. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h1 style="color: rgb(83, 51, 237); ">1. How do I use it?</h1>
                <div style="font-size:18px; color: #333;">
                    <p>
                        To get started, you simply need to visit any news article and click the
                        plugin icon <img style="width: 20px;" src="images/icon32.png"> in the top right of your browser window.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Troogl will analyse the article and display the results directly on the page, as shown below. This typically takes less than 10 seconds, but lengthy articles can take longer.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        <img style="width: 90%; margin: 1.5%; box-shadow: 0 0 5px #333; border-radius: 5px;" src="images/plugin-demo.gif">
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h1 style="color: rgb(83, 51, 237); margin-top: 2.5%;">2. What can I do with Troogl?</h1>
                <div style="font-size:18px; color: #333;;">
                    <p>
                        At the moment, Troogl mostly provides insights that relate to the sentiment of the article (how positive, neutral or negative things are).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The current features of Troogl include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sentences being colored based on its sentiment</li>
                            <li>View a line graph that shows how the sentiment of the article changes from beginning to end</li>
                            <li>The ability to jump between sentences by hovering over different points within the line graph</li>
                            <li>View the sentiment of sentences from the perspective of people and organizations mentioned within the article</li>
                            <li>View a piechart breakdown of sentence sentiments based on the counts of each sentiment type</li>
                            <li>View summary, objectivity, readibility, overall trends</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h1 style="color: rgb(83, 51, 237); margin-top: 2.5%;">3. Things to keep in mind</h1>
                <div style="font-size:18px; color: #333;;">
                    <p>
                        Please keep in mind that Troogl is very early in its development, so there will inevitably be a bunch of issues that have yet to be discovered (to go along with a bunch that already have been).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the most obvious issues right now is a key one - inaccurate sentiment values - particularly for the default 'Everyday News Reader' perspective. Work is being done to tackle this, including the development of a voting system that will give the ability to provide your own input as to the sentiment of sentences, which will help to improve accuracy overtime. As an added benefit, this will also enable you to be able to view the sentiment of articles from your own personal perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of user privacy, Troogl doesn't store any data at all. After analysis of an article is performed, all data that was used to perform the analysis (just the URL of the article right now) is immediately disregarded.
                    </p>
