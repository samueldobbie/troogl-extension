# Troogl - A new way to read the news :newspaper:

![](extension/images/plugin-demo.gif)

Troogl is a browser extension that aims to improve the experience of reading news articles by providing you with interesting, real-time insights into articles as you read them. Coming soon to Chrome and Firefox!

### How do I use it?

1. Add the extension to your browser (links coming soon).
2. Visit any news article.
3. Click the Troogl plugin icon ![](extension/images/icon16.png) in the top right corner of your browser.

Troogl will analyse the article and display the results directly within the article, as shown in the GIF above.

### What can I do with Troogl?

Right now, Troogl primarily provides insights into the sentiment of articles (e.g. how positive, neutral or negative sentences are).

The current features of Troogl include:

- Colour-coded sentences based on sentiment (![](extension/images/pos.png) positive, ![](extension/images/neu.png) neutral, ![](extension/images/neg.png) negative).
- A graph demonstrating the changing sentence sentiments over the course of the article.
- Easy article navigation by hovering over different points within the graph.
- Ability to view sentence sentiments from the perspective of those mentioned in the article.
- Neutral summary of the article.
- A dashboard of metrics such as the read time, readability level, objectivity.
- An overview of the people and orgs who are mentioned positively or negatively.
- ...many other features in the works!

### Things to keep in mind

The Troogl browser extension is very much a proof-of-concept, so there's likely to be a ton of issues that have yet to be discovered (to go along with the bunch that already have been). One of the main areas that needs improvement is the accuracy of sentiment ratings.

Troogl doesn't store any data at all and only operates on the tab you're viewing after you click the plugin icon.
