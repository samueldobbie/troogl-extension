# Troogl - A new way to read the news :newspaper:

![](./src/assets/demo.gif)

Troogl is a browser extension that aims to improve the experience of reading news articles by providing you with interesting, real-time insights into articles as you read them (e.g. sentiment & subjectivity of sentences).

## Installation

*(Other browsers coming soon - sorry!)*

## How do I use it?

1. Install the extension
1. Visit any news article ([try this](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/29/boris-johnson-could-receive-sue-gray-report-this-weekend))
1. Explore the insights!

## What can I do with Troogl?

Right now, Troogl primarily provides insights into the sentiment and subjectivity of sentences within the article. Current features include:

- Colour-coded sentences based on sentiment / subjectivity.
- Graph of changing sentiment / subjectivity over the course of the article.
- Easy article navigation by jumping to points within the graph.
- Full dashboard providing a summary and metrics (e.g. read time, keywords, etc.).

### Privacy  
  
Troogl **doesn't store any data** and only runs on the tab you're actively viewing.
  
### Note  
  
Please keep in mind that this is just a fun, hacky project, so:  
  
- The metrics aren't super accurate right now.  
- It doesn't work perfectly on every site (struggles to parse sentences on BBC News, etc.).  

Have fun!
