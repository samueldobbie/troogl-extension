## What is Troogl?  
  
Troogl is a browser extension that aims to improve the experience of reading news articles by providing you with interesting, real-time insights into articles as you read them (e.g. sentiment & subjectivity of sentences).

## How to use Troogl?  
  
To get started:  
  
1. Install the extension
1. Visit any news article
1. Explore the insights
  
## Enable / disable article detection  
  
Troogl automatically analyses the page when it detects that it contains a news article (can be manually triggered via the plugin popup).  
  
You can enable or disable the automatic article detection and analysis for certain sites (or for all sites) via the settings in the plugin popup.  
  
## Privacy  
  
The extension is open source and **doesn't store any data**.  
  
## Note  
  
Please keep in mind that this is just a fun, hacky project, so:  
  
- The metrics aren't super accurate right now.  
- It doesn't work perfectly on every site (struggles to parse sentences on BBC News, etc.).
